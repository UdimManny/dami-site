1
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,949
I don't think this is it.

2
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,614
Because she said
a white house.

3
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,614
It says 111 Christmas Street.

4
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:47,214
I know 111 Christmas
but this is a blue house.

5
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,714
I don't know,
maybe it was Christmas Circle.

6
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:50,814
Well, did you put
Christmas Circle

7
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:51,880
or Christmas Street?

8
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:53,481
Honey, I don't know.

9
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,281
I don't know what I put it as.

10
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,581
Okay, well, she said
it was a white house

11
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,049
and this is a blue house.

12
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:02,182
Well, why don't we ask?

13
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,981
It's not a big deal.
We're lost.

14
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,915
Just check one more time.
Which one...

15
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,381
There's, like,
four Christmases around here.

16
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:12,381
Why don't we just ask?

17
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,848
Can you just check
one more time?

18
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,347
Honey, you told me...

19
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,614
Just check the e-mail
that she sent one more time.

20
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:18,817
All right. Okay.

21
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,180
I feel like
such an idiot because...

22
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:26,416
No, honey,
we can't help it. Just ask.

23
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:30,180
Take a deep breath.

24
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,514
Let's just go ask.

25
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,015
It's not a big deal.

26
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,347
They have beautiful flowers.

27
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,447
Which one did I say?

28
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:37,582
Which one did I say?
Which street?

29
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,848
You told me 111th Street.

30
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,216
I typed it in, and now
I'm not sure where we are.

31
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,281
<i>What do I
do, just ring on the doorbell?</i>

32
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>I mean, these people
just ring the doorbell.</i>

33
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:55,917
<i>Relax. It's not
a big deal. We're lost.</i>

34
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:00,582
<i>Check one more time
which one.</i>

35
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:02,215
<i>Honey, it says 111...</i>

36
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:03,915
<i>It could be
five minutes away from here,</i>

37
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,382
<i>and we could be at the wrong
place and not even know it...</i>

38
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,814
Vitals are stable.

39
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:09,482
<i>I don't know
if it's Christmas Street,</i>

40
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,682
<i>Court, Lane, Circle.</i>

41
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,148
Mother to Child-One.
We're at set-point.

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,915
- <i>I copy. Over.</i>
- <i>Running kismet.</i>

43
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:18,018
<i>I read you,
Lima Charlie. Help me, over.</i>

44
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,582
- <i>Drone in position.</i>
- <i>I read you same.</i>

45
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,181
<i>Awaiting further instruction.</i>

46
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,081
<i>Thermal is up.</i>

47
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,515
<i>Getting in the networks.</i>

48
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:27,682
<i>We are validating</i>

49
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:28,814
<i>on our primary
and secondary routes...</i>

50
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:30,515
Social media is clear.

51
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:31,882
How's our airspace?

52
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,350
<i>Residential alarm offline.</i>

53
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,018
<i>I've got eyes inside.</i>

54
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,282
Mother,
what's your count?

55
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,482
<i>I've got two
in the kitchen and...</i>

56
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,549
<i>One in the back room.</i>

57
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:40,615
<i>One in the living room.</i>

58
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:41,683
<i>I have one upstairs.</i>

59
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,716
- I count five.
- I'm counting five.

60
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:45,081
<i>I got five, too.</i>

61
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,882
Child-One, there's
five subjects in the house.

62
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:49,348
Copy, Mother.

63
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,882
Child-One, conditions are set.

64
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,982
Let's get in and out
real quick today. No drama.

65
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,048
Here we go.

66
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,718
<i>Child-Two
and Five engage.</i>

67
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:01,918
Ding-dong.

68
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,150
<i>You got a female
coming your way, unarmed.</i>

69
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,849
Hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you,

70
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:16,416
we're looking
for the Larkin home.

71
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,782
Go.

72
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,216
<i>My friend's supposed to
have given this address.</i>

73
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,516
<i>111 Christmas.</i>

74
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,517
<i>My wife, apparently,
gave me the wrong address.</i>

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,632
You have the wrong house.

76
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,499
Honey, I told you
it's the wrong street.

77
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,699
We're looking
for 111 Christmas.

78
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,332
Maybe a Christmas Lane...

79
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,735
...or a Christmas Circle?

80
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,334
Look out!

81
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,302
Now.

82
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,735
<i>You, stop. Let's go.</i>

83
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,000
You, here, hands on the wall.

84
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>Checking the rear.</i>

85
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,534
- <i>One.</i>
- <i>Two.</i>

86
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,467
You, hands on the wall.

87
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,501
<i>Be advised,
we're internal.</i>

88
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:13,735
On the wall. Closer.

89
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:15,568
Three.

90
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,869
Get up.
Against the wall.

91
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:21,967
Put your hands up.

92
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:23,435
<i>Sweep upstairs.</i>

93
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,601
<i>Four.</i>

94
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:33,967
One unknown.

95
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:43,467
<i>Five.</i>

96
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,967
- Clear.
- That's five.

97
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,934
We got five, let's go.

98
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,433
<i>Five subjects
in custody.</i>

99
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:52,100
<i>Start the sweep. Commence SSE.</i>

100
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,166
<i>Roger that.</i>

101
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:54,502
<i>Doug, close it out.</i>

102
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,266
<i>Roger that.
Working on it now.</i>

103
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,168
- <i>Four minutes, 30.</i>
- <i>Clock is ticking.</i>

104
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,500
Turn around.

105
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:12,900
<i>Blow.</i>

106
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:14,102
<i>To the left.</i>

107
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:19,667
I see two computers,
four racks.

108
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,736
<i>Confirm.
What about the safe?</i>

109
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,235
Jackpot.

110
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:28,901
Turn around.

111
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,102
Against the wall.

112
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:38,369
<i>Bite.</i>

113
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,834
<i>I'm in.</i>

114
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,934
Child-One, commencing
full dental impressions

115
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,736
for database crosscheck.

116
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:59,801
Confirm collection

117
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,767
<i>Roger that.</i>

118
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,703
<i>Let's go, people,
the clock is ticking.</i>

119
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,170
<i>Three minutes.</i>

120
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:14,301
Hands up.

121
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,170
Receiving data dump.

122
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:23,468
Downloading scans.

123
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:29,303
My ostensible crew.

124
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,370
My titular crew.

125
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,236
What's that?

126
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,037
Hey, Bishop.

127
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,802
Got a faint heat signal here

128
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:50,002
on the second floor
on the south-west corner.

129
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,203
<i>Can't really make it out.
Sir, I'm trying to.</i>

130
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:56,370
Hmm.

131
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,201
What is it? A squirrel?

132
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:04,037
If that's a squirrel,
it's a big fucking squirrel.

133
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:08,868
Child-One, Mother.
Strong thermal. Second floor.

134
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,835
<i>Strong thermal
on the second floor.</i>

135
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,269
<i>Copy, Mother.
Child-Two, Child-Three?</i>

136
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:14,835
<i>Go look into that.</i>

137
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:17,004
<i>You got 90 seconds,
make it quick.</i>

138
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:48,871
<i>Clear.</i>

139
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:56,003
<i>I'm seeing a room
to your left.</i>

140
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,235
<i>There's nothing on my left.</i>

141
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,703
<i>I'm seeing a room
to your left.</i>

142
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,970
<i>There's a door to your left.</i>

143
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,869
<i>It's just a wall,
not a door.</i>

144
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:04,838
<i>I'm seeing a room...
Fuck. Gun. Gun, gun, gun!</i>

145
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,202
Mother, Child-One,

146
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:29,603
looks like you were
a little light on your count.

147
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:32,003
I think
the vest took that.

148
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,303
- <i>You got him. You good?</i>
- <i>I'm good. Let's go.</i>

149
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:35,372
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

150
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:47,836
<i>Child-One,
what are we doing?</i>

151
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,803
<i>Stay put,
we're on the clock.</i>

152
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:52,906
You got to be
kidding me.

153
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,236
Assault-One KIA.

154
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:59,703
<i>Child-One, Mother.
Collection is terminated.</i>

155
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,172
<i>We are weapons free.</i>

00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,006
- Confirm, capture to kill.
- Confirm.

157
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:20,370
- Confirming capture to kill.
- <i>Confirm.</i>

158
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,073
They're gonna torch it.

159
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,004
- <i>...Christmas Street.</i>
- <i>911...</i>

160
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:37,971
<i>...just sort of
really loud explosion...</i>

161
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:39,503
Fire and Police
have been alerted.

<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

165
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,972
<i>Okay, so you want me
to waste this guy</i>

166
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,537
<i>in broad fucking daylight?</i>

167
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,604
Confirm.

<i>Child-One,

<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

170
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,206
<i>Kill CCTV-1, CCTV-2.</i>

171
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,173
<i>Let's go.</i>

172
00:11:57,873 --> 00:12:00,905
Child-One, Mother.
You're clear for four miles.

173
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,738
We are gonna be with you
for full exfil.

174
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,404
Continue on the current route
to the park exit.

175
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,571
<i>There will be a parking lot...</i>

179
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,338
<i>in, what sources say,
was a Russian safehouse.</i>

180
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,438
<i>Sources inside
the US intelligence community</i>

181
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,939
<i>indicated that this was
an FSB hit on its own,</i>

182
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:31,371
<i>perhaps an attempt to
manufacture what appeared</i>

183
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,638
<i>to be an assault
on Russian civilians,</i>

184
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,839
<i>but was, in fact,
a kind of suicide...</i>

185
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:37,438
<i>This is clearly
a slaughterhouse</i>

186
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,806
<i>turned in on itself.</i>

187
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,238
<i>...what they
describe as a quiet, safe,</i>

188
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,438
<i>and friendly community.</i>

189
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,872
<i>One of
the victims, disturbingly,</i>

190
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:46,073
<i>an 18-year-old Russian male.</i>

191
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:50,205
<i>This is uncharacteristic for
the KGB to be targeting...</i>

192
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,538
<i>The victim,
apparently 18 years of age.</i>

193
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,973
<i>And this is truly shocking...</i>

194
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:56,006
<i>White House
official indicated</i>

195
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,404
<i>that this was
a Russia-led operation.</i>

196
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:59,138
<i>More information
will be coming out.</i>

197
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,205
<i>They have been playing it very
close to the vest of the FBI.</i>

198
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,872
Here's
your non-disclosure.

199
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,739
We're transcribing
and recording.

200
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,741
There might be a finding.

201
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:12,172
We live in a new world.
These are bloody times.

202
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:15,708
Evil exists. Horror exists.
The great game continues.

203
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:18,372
If you have patience,

204
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:19,975
you wouldn't have expected it
to end, so...

205
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:22,806
Most governments have
very little patience.

206
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:23,973
What is a government anyway?

207
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,173
Does a government
have a heartbeat?

208
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:27,240
Does a government have
ten fingers and ten toes?

209
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,672
A government is capable
of vengeance.

210
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:33,192
Is a government
capable of slaughter?

211
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:41,756
<i>The American
people do not see their work</i>

212
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,325
<i>or know their names.</i>

213
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:03,823
<i>Lieutenant Silva
showed exceptional courage</i>

214
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,992
<i>in extreme danger.</i>

215
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:11,256
<i>Subject, James Silva,
age seven.</i>

216
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:13,355
<i>He's not
like other little boys.</i>

217
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:16,390
<i>Mrs. Silva, I believe
your son may be gifted.</i>

218
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,324
<i>There's nothing
wrong with you, Jimmy.</i>

219
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,525
<i>Your mind just moves faster
than the other kids.</i>

220
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:29,592
<i>Snap this
when you can't slow down.</i>

221
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,423
<i>Just like that.</i>

222
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,391
<i>We need to talk
about your anger, Jimmy.</i>

223
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,790
A tragic scene on

224
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,456
<i>Jericho Turnpike
this morning...</i>

225
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,090
<i>...killing
a mother and her twin sons.</i>

226
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,023
<i>A third son,
11-year-old Jimmy Silva,</i>

227
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,025
<i>is in critical condition.</i>

228
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:03,525
<i>We do have
some other activities.</i>

229
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,325
<i>I won't discuss those other
activities at this time.</i>

230
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,227
<i>It requires
a change in tactics.</i>

231
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:18,091
<i>A tightly knit,
highly efficient machine.</i>

232
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,523
<i>We will direct
every tool of intelligence,</i>

233
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,758
<i>until there's no refuge.</i>

234
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,991
<i>...ramping up
of these wars</i>

235
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,993
<i>outside of the war zones.</i>

236
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,758
<i>Grade 546...</i>

237
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,858
<i>Eyes on a blue sedan.</i>

238
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,291
<i>Copy.
You're clear to engage.</i>

239
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,523
<i>You're authorized</i>

240
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,125
<i>to go break the law
in other countries,</i>

241
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:40,256
<i>and you have the presidential
authority to do it.</i>

242
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:42,125
<i>The real
abilities that we have,</i>

243
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:45,559
<i>this is something
nobody can even understand.</i>

244
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:52,626
<i>James Silva,
welcome to the new wars.</i>

245
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,892
I need to know before we start
this conversation

246
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:39,194
how bad of a mood are you in.

247
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,825
What you want?
Like one to ten?

248
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,925
Yeah.

249
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,792
Seven and rising quickly.

250
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,291
There's no caesium
in the crate, Jimmy.

251
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,393
What?

252
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:53,425
<i>What was in it?</i>

253
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:55,358
<i>Twelve cases
of M4 rifles,</i>

254
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,760
<i>18 guns per case,</i>

255
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,658
<i>180 M67 grenades.</i>

256
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,592
We broke them to pieces,
no caesium.

257
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:01,726
<i>There were paintings.</i>

258
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:02,760
<i>We tore the canvases
off the frames.</i>

259
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:03,893
<i>There's no caesium.</i>

260
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,192
<i>Repeat, no caesium.</i>

261
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:06,793
<i>Repeat, no caesium found.
Just some grenades.</i>

262
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,693
We tore
the whole fucking thing apart.

263
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,327
- Paintings?
- Fakes.

264
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,159
Munch. Norwegian.

265
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,226
Munch as in <i>The Scream?</i>

266
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:14,995
Yeah. But it wasn't
<i>The Scream.</i>

267
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,161
Well, this is
a big fucking problem.

268
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:20,960
Where's Alice?

269
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,760
Where is she?
It was her source.

270
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:24,693
We all thought the source
was credible, Jimmy.

271
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,893
Just shut the fuck up.

272
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,092
I never liked this lead.
Causing avalanches.

273
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,893
This is basically what
this is, this is an avalanche.

274
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,092
'Cause we have now what?
Sam, what do we have now?

275
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:35,092
- What do we have now, huh?
- Nothing.

276
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:37,326
- Dougie, what do we have now?
- Nothing.

277
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:38,993
Six sets of caesium
still missing.

278
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:41,159
Eleven discs per set.
That's 66 missing discs.

279
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,160
That's 66 dirty bombs.
At least. Right?

280
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:44,459
We all thought it was real.

281
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,995
Oh, it is very real.
This is a big fucking problem.

282
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,726
What is this?

283
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,826
It's Sam's birthday.

284
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,526
It's my birthday.

285
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:54,129
Oh. Happy birthday.

286
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,060
No birthday cake.
No birthday cake.

287
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,994
Your source sucked.

288
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:07,160
- What, he lied to you?
- It happens.

289
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:10,193
We are well outside the realm
of "it happens," Alice. Okay?

290
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,994
This is not a case
where shit can happen.

291
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:13,093
We are not talking about

292
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:14,294
stolen fucking
ice cream cones here.

293
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:15,961
I'm handling it.

294
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,127
Oh, you're handling it?

295
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,761
Really?
Do you need help with that?

296
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:19,927
No, I don't.

297
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,861
- Who is the source?
- Local special forces.

298
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:23,726
You running a cop?

299
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,527
Since when do we trust local
special forces? Jesus, Alice.

300
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,394
He's been an excellent source.

301
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,994
Is that supposed to mean
something to me

302
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:31,127
that he is
an excellent source?

303
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,227
Do you want me to tell
John Porter,

304
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:33,593
"Oh, he's
an excellent source"?

305
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,161
No, I don't think so. That
story does not work for me.

306
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:36,792
It's not a story, Jimmy.
It's the truth.

307
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:39,659
No, this cannot not work,
all right? I trusted you.

308
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,029
Does that mean anything
to you?

309
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,263
Hello?

310
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,294
I'm handling it.

311
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:47,361
You know
what's in the container?

312
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:49,027
Edvard Munch.
You ever seen a Munch?

313
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,927
I mean,
this guy is dark as fuck.

314
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,327
Sounds perfect for you, Jimmy.

315
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,560
You know,
I don't appreciate that.

316
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,929
I actually resent that.
Thank you.

317
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,027
Wow. 120 million at auction.

318
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,194
Jimmy.

319
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,227
He was a Sagittarius,
just like you.

320
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,327
I should have been a painter.

321
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,596
Take a breath.

322
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,793
Go outside.

323
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,630
Yeah, the sign outside
says "ladies."

324
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:20,361
He hears everything,
never listens.

325
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:21,960
He listens
to what works for him.

326
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:23,860
So, what works for him?

327
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,862
Actionable intelligence.

328
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:27,962
And pain.

329
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:36,894
<i>The definition
of a war zone</i>

330
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:38,927
<i>is an interesting thing.</i>

331
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,427
Being a cop in Baltimore might
be every bit as dangerous

332
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:42,829
as being a cop in Baghdad.

333
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:51,095
The cops played
the politicians

334
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:52,494
and the politicians
played the cops

335
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:55,461
and I don't think anyone ever
knew who is on whose side.

336
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:02,262
I think he got scared, Jimmy.

337
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:04,728
He's an honest guy.
He's been 100% reliable.

338
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,028
Yeah,
there's a big difference

339
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,162
between honest and reliable,
Alice.

340
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:09,028
I'll handle it.

341
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,494
How's that going, by the way?
Do you want me to take that?

342
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:12,995
- Let me get the phone.
- I want to get it later.

343
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:14,595
No, you'll take it now and
end whatever is happening

344
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:15,928
on the other side
of that phone

345
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,562
so you can return home
from that planet to this one.

346
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,494
I need you here with me.
Do you understand?

347
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,562
Can I help you, sir?

348
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,128
Sir. Ma'am,
you have a walk-in.

349
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,262
You know what,
I'll take the walk-in.

350
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:24,595
You're gonna take the walk-in?

351
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,028
I said I'll take the walk-in.
Is that okay with you?

352
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,595
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?

353
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:29,495
- You want to take the walk-in?
- No, sir.

354
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,928
Okay, then,
I'll take the walk-in.

355
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,061
Alice, handle the ex and then
we handle the source, okay?

356
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:34,728
Can you do that for me?
Let's go. Show me the walk-in.

357
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,529
I want a solution, okay?
Not a bunch of excuses.

358
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,264
I'll handle
the fucking walk-in.

359
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,995
Hey, how are you?

360
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,263
I'm well, how are you?

361
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,163
Excellent, thank...
Wow, that's a beautiful pin.

362
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:51,495
The government is going to
seize my assets.

363
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,028
I have $1.3 billion.

364
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,096
That's very impressive.

365
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:55,196
I know a lot of people
in America.

366
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,262
It's beautiful.

367
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:57,529
I know Warren Buffett.

368
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,428
- You know Warren Buffett?
- Yes. Mr. Warren Buffett.

369
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,196
I can pay whatever it takes.

370
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:02,328
You're offering me
whatever it takes or...

371
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,564
No, no, no. No, no.

372
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:07,062
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

373
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,428
I'm sorry
I missed all those calls.

374
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,794
<i>I need to confirm</i>

375
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,996
<i>that you are not going to be
at her school on Mother's Day.</i>

376
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,262
You just wanted
to confirm that?

377
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,829
<i>Correct.
Diane is gonna take her...</i>

378
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:17,129
You know I can't be there.

379
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:19,229
- Are you recording this?
- <i>Pardon me?</i>

380
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,328
You know it's illegal
to record me, Luke.

381
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,529
<i>I am just trying...</i>

382
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,395
I'm the 17th richest person
in this country.

383
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:24,629
They liquidate my accounts,

384
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:27,062
my whole family is
going to be ruined.

385
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,262
I will have nothing.

386
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,529
Well, that's a shame.

387
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,196
Are you familiar with
Lincoln's First Inaugural,

388
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:32,596
delivered March 1861?

389
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:35,598
Better angels and the bonds
of affection? No?

390
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,096
All right. Abraham Lincoln
was from Kentucky.

391
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:39,462
You ever been to Kentucky?

392
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:41,262
What about Nebraska? Where
your friend Warren was born?

393
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:42,465
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

394
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,062
- Hey.
- <i>Look.</i>

395
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,532
You got your ears pierced?

396
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,429
Oh, wow.

397
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:50,996
You look so grown up.
Your dad took you?

398
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:52,463
<i>No, Diane took me.</i>

399
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:53,762
<i>Are you coming
to Mother's Day?</i>

400
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,729
<i>I thought you would make
blue cupcakes with me.</i>

401
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:58,195
You know I can't be there.
I'm really sorry.

402
00:22:58,197 --> 00:22:59,296
<i>Okay, I'll save one for you.</i>

403
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:01,363
You know what America
does not need?

404
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,829
Another rich person

405
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,929
scared about the liquidation
of her accounts.

406
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,630
- <i>It's just earrings.</i>
- You know that I would...

407
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:08,530
<i>Don't give me the attitude.
She wanted the earrings.</i>

408
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:09,695
And by the way, it's not

409
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,296
Warren Buffett anymore.
It's Buff-ay.

410
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:13,496
- Ba-ffay?
- Bu-ffay.

411
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:14,862
- Buff-ay?
- Buff-ay.

412
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,896
Warren Buffett. He doesn't
live in Nebraska anymore.

413
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:17,896
He lives in Paris.

414
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,929
You need the French Embassy.

415
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,030
You speak French?

416
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,296
I'm the mother, Luke.

417
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:24,063
<i>Oh, right. And Diane will be
the step-mother,</i>

418
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:25,762
<i>and she's actually able
to be there.</i>

419
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,829
I'm gonna give you
the personal mobile number

420
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:29,030
of the French Ambassador.

421
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,030
He's a very good friend of
mine. He's gonna hook you up.

422
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:32,263
He's single, by the way.

423
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,830
You tell him that Steve Bannon
sent you, okay?

424
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:35,496
- This is his number.
- Thank you, Mr. Bannon.

425
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,196
<i>You think you're the only one
that's out there working?</i>

426
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:38,363
<i>You think it's so easy?</i>

427
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:40,429
- You motherfucker.
- <i>What? I can't hear you.</i>

428
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,463
- You motherfucker!
- <i>Bingo.</i>

429
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:43,763
<i>Alice, good job.</i>

430
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:46,063
<i>Welcome back to
the FamilyWizard, sweetheart.</i>

431
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,130
- No.
- <i>Yes. You're wizard-ed.</i>

432
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,429
- Wait.
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

433
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:52,163
Tell her that I love her. No!

434
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,865
Fucking motherfucker!

435
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:57,933
Are we done here now?

436
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:02,897
Let's go.

437
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,529
<i>Sam Snel, you have a walk-in.</i>

438
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:06,698
<i>Sam Snel, you have a walk-in.</i>

439
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,764
<i>Everyone thinks</i>

440
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:42,966
<i>they know everything now.</i>

441
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,830
<i>You think you know
about election hacking?</i>

442
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:48,198
<i>You think you understand
the definition of "collusion"?</i>

443
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,899
You know nothing.

444
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,164
<i>Last night we had
a seven-man team at the port,</i>

445
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,997
acting on what we believed
was accurate intelligence

446
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,131
regarding four pounds
of stolen C-139,

447
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,630
a new form of caesium-137
radioactive powder.

448
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:06,764
Just to understand
the magnitude,

449
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:07,931
four pounds is enough

450
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,630
to make six major cities
uninhabitable.

451
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:12,032
We identified the container,

452
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,797
there was nothing in it
but weapons and some fake art,

453
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,697
all of which Doug and Sam
meticulously disassembled.

454
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,797
No caesium was found.
The intel was bad.

455
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,865
Whose source was it?

456
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:20,965
That'd be on me, John.

457
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:22,564
- Whose source?
- It's on me, John.

458
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,730
How much
are we paying him?

459
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,164
He didn't want money.

460
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,064
We tried to pay him,
and he gave it away.

461
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:29,530
- To who?
- Local senior citizen center.

462
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:32,398
- FamilyWizard.
- What?

463
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,032
He's been accurate on
everything else, John, 100%.

464
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,398
And he appears driven
and motivated

465
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,564
by something
other than funding.

466
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:40,598
- Fix this.
- Oh, it's gonna be fixed.

467
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,064
Every one of
these events occurred

468
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,463
as a result of a failure
of imagination.

469
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:48,398
Your job is not to predict
tomorrow based on yesterday.

470
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,831
That's what academics do.

471
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,998
Your job is to prevent
the end of tomorrow

472
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,765
by using your brains
and your imagination.

473
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,565
If you don't find the caesium
before it's too late,

474
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:58,932
you will be held responsible

475
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,197
for the single largest
intelligence fumble

476
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,598
since a flight instruction
school in Florida

477
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,097
failed to grasp
the significance

478
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,032
of a 19-year-old
Al-Qaeda terrorist

479
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,767
saying he didn't need to learn
how to land.

480
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,134
So fucking wake up.

481
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:19,265
Very impressive list, John.
Greatest Hits of Shit Show.

482
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,198
You didn't give
the French Ambassador's

483
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,831
mobile number to a walk-in?
Did you?

484
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,299
Uh, yeah, maybe I did.

485
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:30,833
I don't need phone calls from
the French Ambassador, Jimmy.

486
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:34,899
- Is she all right?
- I got her.

487
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:37,431
I don't need
radioactive powder discs

488
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,565
floating around
unaccounted for.

489
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:42,732
This is such shit.

490
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,598
This is the worst fucking shit

491
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,933
of all the fucked up shit
we've ever seen.

492
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,899
This is the shittiest,
most fucked up shit...

493
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,398
I got it, okay? Relax.
Calm down.

494
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,165
- Go take a little nap.
- Fuck you.

495
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,364
FamilyWizard?

496
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,832
It's a divorce app.

497
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,566
Cuts out direct communication.

498
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,332
- It lowers conflict.
- It's working.

499
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:03,465
Edits your emails,
copies them to the lawyers.

500
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:04,566
It doesn't like certain words.

501
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:05,799
Like what?

502
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:07,999
"Prick. Whore. Cocksucker.
Male whore, sadist.

503
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,599
"Fucking asshole,
fucking psychopath,

504
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,799
"fucking deadbeat,
fucking idiot,

505
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:11,899
"fucking parsimonious,
dictatorial,

506
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:13,065
"abusive motherfucking..."

507
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,699
I got it. You're upset,
suck it up, okay?

508
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,799
I have no ability
to communicate

509
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,899
with my daughter now.

510
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:19,132
You're never gonna do
something normal

511
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,033
until you die.
That's what this job is.

512
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,098
I think I've lied to every
person that I've ever met.

513
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,666
So what? You really
wanna get into this now?

514
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,165
- No.
- "No," what?

515
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,799
No to your black vision
of everything.

516
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:28,999
If you can't fucking tell,

517
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,199
I'm not in the mood
to be light-housed.

518
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,699
This is dark work, Alice.
And you requested it.

519
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,866
And I'm not gonna be washing
strawberry jam

520
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:35,300
out of my swimsuit
this summer,

521
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:36,499
I get to wash blood.

522
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:37,632
Only maybe not
because they don't make

523
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:38,966
a detergent for that.

524
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,099
And you can forget about sex
on Sundays, there are no

525
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:41,666
- Sundays in our world.
- None.

526
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:42,799
- The job comes first.
- You said it.

527
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,099
- You said it.
- You said it, and you've

528
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,732
learned well. You're starting
to make me proud.

529
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:47,732
- I'm not you.
- You're pretty close.

530
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:48,934
Just take the fucking
medicine, Al, okay?

531
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,133
It's halfway down your throat.

532
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,135
- You need a vacation.
- For what?

533
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:56,833
- You need a week on a beach.
- This is my beach.

534
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:57,967
I love it here.

535
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,367
There is no absolution, Al,
all right?

536
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:02,233
There is no washing out
what we do.

537
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:04,733
Unless, of course,
you try that Jesus guy.

538
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,267
I mean, they say
he's very forgiving.

539
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,633
They also say,
"Thou shall not kill."

540
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,668
You and I have put up some
serious numbers, young lady.

541
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:14,367
Fuck.

542
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,233
We were not there
to keep the peace, all right?

543
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,367
There was no peace.

544
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,269
We were there
to limit the violence.

545
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:28,400
Hey, get back!

546
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,534
Sometimes that's all it takes
for a guy to take a risk.

547
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,933
For a guy to do
the right thing.

548
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:34,367
You, get back!

549
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:35,902
<i>Asian male
approaching. Please advise.</i>

550
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>Be advised.
There's one male subject</i>

551
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,502
<i>right at the front gate.</i>

552
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:52,900
People are rarely rational.

553
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:54,000
- Put it down.
- A gift.

554
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:55,700
People are highly
self-destructive.

555
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:56,933
On your knees.

556
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,233
The definition of an unknown
known is a thing which exists,

557
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:00,468
but which
you don't know about,

558
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,267
and which you cannot
even imagine.

559
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:03,435
Back up! End of the road!

560
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,766
Let me see both hands.

561
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,468
Back. Get back.

562
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,966
Put your hands in the air.

563
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,600
Get back!
End of the road!

564
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:11,900
What the hell is that?

565
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:13,169
Get back!

566
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:21,966
<i>Most sources
lie right to your face.</i>

567
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,501
When they have what you need,

568
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:25,270
they know they have the power.

569
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,801
That's my asset.

570
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:15,134
- Who is he?
- Li Noor.

571
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:16,334
I don't wanna know his name,

572
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,368
I don't wanna know
what he does for a living,

573
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,301
- I wanna know who is he?
- A loner.

574
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:22,268
No kids. No family.
100% accurate and reliable.

575
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,334
You marked him
or he marked you?

576
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:24,402
I marked him.

577
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:26,034
He says
he has the exact locations

578
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:27,301
of all six sets of caesium.

579
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,801
He's locked it on a disc.

580
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:30,502
He says only if we get him
out of the country

581
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:32,901
and give him asylum
will he open the disc.

582
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:34,635
You're gonna deal with this
or you want me to handle it?

583
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:36,302
I got it.

584
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,601
This is serious, right?

585
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:38,636
Oh, very.

586
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,235
Oh, fuck.

587
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:59,634
- This is an ouroborus drive.
- What the fuck is that?

588
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:01,402
It means
it's gonna self-destruct.

589
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:04,202
The entire program is gonna
eat itself in eight hours.

590
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,601
It's gonna be gone.

591
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:08,937
He's smart. Time is insurance,
so he gets what he wants.

592
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:15,968
No, I didn't.

593
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,171
You didn't?

594
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:21,935
Open the disc, Li.

595
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,935
I want out of the country.

596
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,269
The information on the disc

597
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,437
will lead to the safe return
of the stolen caesium

598
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,237
and to the complete political
collapse of the country.

599
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,601
Which country?

600
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:48,768
The country
you're currently sitting in.

601
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:54,470
Are you under the impression

602
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:56,868
that you are in a position
to make demands?

603
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,272
I tell you what I want,
and you give it to me.

604
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:05,272
Open the motherfucking disc.

605
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,670
You're wasting time.

606
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,303
Do you think
that because I'm a woman

607
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:20,603
I'm less capable
of extreme violence?

608
00:32:23,838 --> 00:32:25,603
I'll go get a sledgehammer

609
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:30,805
and an ice-axe
and I will fuck you up.

610
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:45,439
Take a closer look
at the paintings.

611
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:51,471
<i>Li was a man
of his word.</i>

612
00:32:51,473 --> 00:32:53,671
He gave us the exact location
of the caesium.

613
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:58,336
<i>He was telling us the truth
on the crate.</i>

614
00:32:58,338 --> 00:32:59,969
<i>So we took him at his word
on the remaining</i>

615
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,303
<i>caesium locations.</i>

616
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:04,569
<i>Certain operations require
a level of violence</i>

617
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,669
not palatable to most people.

618
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:10,569
And certain operations require
a higher level of deniability.

619
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,771
- This is Overwatch, John.
- Give me a moment.

620
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:18,271
You and I both know this is
an Overwatch operation.

621
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:20,769
What was that thing about
"unadvisedly or lightly"?

622
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:22,171
Oh, some things
should not be entered

623
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:23,404
into unadvisedly or lightly

624
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:24,669
but reverently, discreetly
advisedly, soberly,

625
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,803
and in the fear of God.
That thing?

626
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,571
- Yeah.
- That's the thing.

627
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,037
I'm not gonna authorize it,
Jimmy.

628
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,171
But you can warm him up.

629
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:37,803
- Oh, I'm gonna warm him up.
- Discreetly.

630
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:38,839
Discreetly.

631
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:58,404
<i>I really
don't like diplomats.</i>

632
00:33:58,406 --> 00:34:00,137
Diplomacy never works
once the match

633
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,470
has been lit
to start the fire.

634
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,737
"Oh, look at that fire.

635
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:05,937
"Let's drink tea and talk
about hearts and minds."

636
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:07,273
No. I don't think so.

637
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:14,104
How can
I help you, gentlemen?

638
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:16,239
I'm here to see
Ambassador Brady.

639
00:34:21,173 --> 00:34:23,071
He won't talk.
He doesn't feel safe.

640
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:24,372
Oh, does he want
to go back outside?

641
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:26,504
'Cause I'm not sure
he'll feel safe there either.

642
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:27,904
Listen up.
We have a situation.

643
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,670
Deputy Foreign Minister
is here. He wants the cop.

644
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:30,937
So whatever you guys
are doing here,

645
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:32,004
I suggest you chop-chop.

646
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:33,104
Well, that makes things

647
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,172
a little more interesting,
don't it?

648
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:35,272
Do not give him up, Brady.

649
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,471
I wasn't planning
on giving him up.

650
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:37,870
You have
any other advice for me?

651
00:34:37,872 --> 00:34:39,072
Anything else? You sure?

652
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,305
No, no, just making
a friendly suggestion.

653
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,105
Thank you. You cracked it yet?

654
00:34:42,107 --> 00:34:43,305
I'm gonna need
a little more time.

655
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:44,670
You need time?

656
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,072
I don't have any time.

657
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:48,272
Didn't they teach you anything
about caesium at Harvard?

658
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:49,570
I didn't go to Harvard.

659
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:51,172
You didn't graduate Harvard
with Mark Zuckerberg?

660
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:52,905
Actually Mark Zuckerberg
didn't graduate.

661
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,372
I'm not talking to you.

662
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:55,770
Were you born
on second base or third?

663
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:56,871
'Cause I can never remember.

664
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:58,905
- I'm Scottsdale, Arizona...
- I don't give a shit.

665
00:34:58,907 --> 00:35:00,905
They didn't teach you anything
about caesium at MIT?

666
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:02,238
I didn't go to MIT.

667
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,805
Well, let me give you
a little science lesson then.

668
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:06,205
You know what happens
when you ionize a protein?

669
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,305
You ever read <i>Hiroshima,</i>
by John Hersey?

670
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,838
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer,
essay on the atom bomb.

671
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,570
'Cause John Hersey wrote about
the survivors, all right?

672
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:13,971
He wrote about
how he reached out

673
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,138
to take the hands of women

674
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,704
in the wake
of the bombing in Japan

675
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:18,471
and their skin
slipped off like gloves.

676
00:35:18,473 --> 00:35:20,072
And then you know
what happens next?

677
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,638
Your kidneys fail.
Your lungs collapse.

678
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,272
You cannot breathe,
you cannot think.

679
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:25,505
Your thyroid just evaporates,
all right?

680
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,771
Then your lymphocyte
cell count takes a nose dive.

681
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:28,771
Jimmy.

682
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,371
We're looking at approximately
60,000 people

683
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,871
becoming Jell-O
on our watch, all right?

684
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:33,205
That's what this shit does.

685
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:36,805
Caesium-139 is Hiroshima
and Nagasaki combined.

686
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:37,905
Only you don't need

687
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:38,971
sophisticated planes
to place it.

688
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,238
You only need a kid

689
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,174
who can empty an envelope
on a sidewalk.

690
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,472
Do your job
and crack the code.

691
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,139
You know,
I think I'll go meet

692
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,340
the new
Deputy Foreign Minister.

693
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,338
What exactly is Silva's
psychological problem?

694
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,573
He doesn't like
computer people.

695
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:10,941
Fuckin' nerds.

696
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:39,707
What is your name?

697
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:42,906
Li Noor.

698
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:45,707
- Repeat after me. Blue.
- Blue.

699
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:48,272
- Strange.
- Strange.

700
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,272
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

701
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,605
- Egg.
- Egg.

702
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:53,473
Do you know what it feels like
to fall in love?

703
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,373
Dangerous.

704
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:55,672
What does it feel like
to kill a man?

705
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:56,674
Nothing.

706
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:01,240
- Repeat after me. Green.
- Green.

707
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:02,639
- White.
- White.

708
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,972
Are you an agent
of the Israeli government?

709
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,174
No.

710
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:06,772
Are you an agent of
the Pakistani government?

711
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:07,639
No.

712
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:09,006
Are you involved
in acts of espionage

713
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:10,174
against your own government?

714
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,339
Yes.

715
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:13,074
Do you possess the code
to open the disc?

716
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:14,140
Yes.

717
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:15,607
Can we trust you?

718
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:18,906
Yes.

719
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:20,040
- Romeo.
- Romeo.

720
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,442
- Juliet.
- Juliet.

721
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:25,475
- Where is that code?
- In my mind.

722
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:29,239
If transported
to the United States,

723
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,674
will you open it?

724
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,341
Yes.

725
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,606
Two cups of sugar.

726
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:03,809
And a cup
of blueberries, you...

727
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:07,239
Shit!

728
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:18,807
<i>So here's the thing...</i>

729
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:22,074
We take our request for asylum
extremely seriously.

730
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:23,207
If you have him, Brady,

731
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,873
we'd like him back.
That's all.

732
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,274
He's wanted for espionage.

733
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:27,507
- Espionage?
- Yes.

734
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:30,340
- What do you mean?
- How's everybody doing?

735
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,873
If you have him, we would
very much like him back.

736
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,276
Somebody lose a dog?

737
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:36,608
Fuck!

738
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:42,008
You good?

739
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,209
Yes.

740
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:49,544
He's crying wolf.

741
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,408
He's a witch.

742
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,841
A witch? What, like a good
witch or a wicked witch?

743
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:56,008
Like a witch with a big nose
and a broom?

744
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,107
Axel, this is
a friendly meeting.

745
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:00,942
We're talking about a corrupt,
low-level cop.

746
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:02,741
I think the fact
that you're sitting here

747
00:40:02,743 --> 00:40:04,677
indicates he's not
so low level.

748
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,310
I can assure you
that the appropriate choice

749
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:24,443
is to hand him over.

750
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:25,509
You assure me?

751
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,045
I mean, can you assure me
that those

752
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,842
circling helicopters
are in our airspace

753
00:41:28,844 --> 00:41:30,509
for a cop not worth my time?

754
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:31,642
- Jimmy...
- Do you know

755
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:32,742
how airspace works?

756
00:41:32,744 --> 00:41:33,842
Do you know there's, like,

757
00:41:33,844 --> 00:41:35,209
a silo that goes up
from this building

758
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,542
all the way up to Heaven?

759
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:37,909
You send choppers
into that silo,

760
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:40,176
you're in violation, speaking
of what's appropriate.

761
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:41,243
Jimmy...

762
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,245
I'm just stating the facts.

763
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:44,776
This is Brady.

764
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:45,842
Be careful.

765
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:47,842
Oh, you fucking be careful.

766
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:49,676
Where were they found?

767
00:41:49,678 --> 00:41:51,044
Is the situation contained?

768
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:53,778
You should trust me, James.
It's good for your health.

769
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,910
Do you have men
wandering our embassy?

770
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:58,475
- Absolutely not.
- Good.

771
00:41:58,477 --> 00:41:59,809
Because the men
who were wandering

772
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,946
the embassy
are now absolutely dead.

773
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:03,345
Let's go.

774
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,245
Get up!

775
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:24,979
Hands behind your head!

776
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:28,111
Hands behind your head!

777
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:30,845
Turn around!

778
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:42,276
About the fog of war
and imagine chaos

779
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:44,743
on a battlefield.
Armies. Tanks. Smoke. Fire.

780
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,944
But it depends on your
definition of battlefield.

781
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:49,210
A battlefield can be
a room with two people in it.

782
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:51,076
That's chaos. That's fog.

783
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,311
The assassination attempt

784
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:03,677
<i>meant that Li had to be
a very high-value asset.</i>

785
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,112
Or a direct threat to them.

786
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:10,013
Prepare my resignation papers.

787
00:43:11,812 --> 00:43:14,379
Either way,
we had to protect him.

788
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:19,410
<i>Warriors don't wear uniforms
anymore.</i>

789
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:22,643
<i>There are no uniforms
in war now.</i>

790
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:23,911
<i>The little girl
that looks like</i>

791
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:25,077
<i>your little sister's
hippie friend on holiday</i>

792
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,013
<i>might be a weapon of
mass destruction.</i>

793
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:30,244
<i>The start of
an operation is just</i>

794
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:31,844
<i>like the start of
anything else.</i>

795
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:34,047
<i>Everything could go right.
Everything could go wrong.</i>

796
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,945
<i>Diplomacy is option one.
Military's option two.</i>

797
00:43:39,947 --> 00:43:41,911
<i>When option one and option two
are abandoned,</i>

798
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:43,346
<i>there is only one thing left.</i>

799
00:43:45,213 --> 00:43:46,844
Which is us.

800
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:48,413
We are the third option.

801
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,710
<i>Special situations teams.
Special missions units.</i>

802
00:43:58,712 --> 00:44:01,447
<i>Smart people on short notice
to solve problems.</i>

803
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:05,344
<i>The two teams,
they are by design</i>

804
00:44:05,346 --> 00:44:07,646
<i>2,000 miles from one another.</i>

805
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,311
<i>The Overwatch location</i>

806
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:13,180
<i>is America's most closely
guarded secret.</i>

807
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:25,977
Mmm-hmm.

808
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:38,678
An op is a living thing.

809
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,111
Once you launch,
the op has a life of its own.

810
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,479
- Sam, what's the op?
- It's classified.

811
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:44,911
- The op is classified?
- Correct.

812
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:45,977
Sam, we don't need
the attitude.

813
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:47,044
You know what, Sam?
Your attitude

814
00:44:47,046 --> 00:44:48,412
is turning
into a real problem.

815
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:49,578
You know what?
I'll go work on it

816
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,879
after you go fuck yourself.
Okay, Victor?

817
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:58,112
This is a Title 50
Overwatch operation.

818
00:44:58,114 --> 00:45:00,279
Overwatch protocols
will be in effect

819
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,747
for the next 180 minutes.

820
00:45:04,481 --> 00:45:08,245
The package is Li Noor.

821
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,978
He spent seven years
in our host country's

822
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,878
elite tactical squad.

823
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,512
He has no known family.

824
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:21,312
The goal is to deliver
that package from here,

825
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:24,379
22 miles to our Angel.

826
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:27,245
Nine pounds of
radioactive isotope,

827
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:30,112
otherwise known as
caesium-139,

828
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,747
otherwise known as
Fear Powder is missing.

829
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:38,579
<i>Mr. Noor knows
exactly where it is.</i>

830
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:42,112
<i>He has locked the information
on a disc,</i>

831
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,413
and it is deconstructing
even as we speak.

832
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:50,012
<i>He wants asylum.
He wants America.</i>

833
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:52,314
Only when we get him
to the plane

834
00:45:53,648 --> 00:45:57,845
will he give us the code
to unlock the disc.

835
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:00,547
<i>She can only stay on
the ground ten minutes.</i>

836
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,978
So we are extremely limited.

837
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,778
<i>Speed matters.</i>

838
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,713
<i>We have a team of
seven operators.</i>

839
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,315
<i>They are no longer employees
of the US government.</i>

840
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:24,449
<i>They are engaged in
a higher form of patriotism.</i>

841
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:28,549
They are ghosts.

842
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,907
You're not a witch, are you?

843
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:55,306
No.

844
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,240
Are you?

845
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,104
Prepare for
net changeover. Ready.

846
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:35,472
And in five,

847
00:47:35,474 --> 00:47:37,173
<i>four,</i>

848
00:47:37,674 --> 00:47:39,238
...three, two...

849
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,240
...one.

850
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:46,506
<i>Child-One, Mother.
We are active on new comms.</i>

851
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:49,973
<i>Do I believe
in Santa Claus?</i>

852
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,007
<i>No.</i>

853
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:53,005
<i>Tooth fairy?</i>

854
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:54,005
Uh-uh.

855
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:56,071
Did I believe that
my three ex-wives meant it

856
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,839
when they said that
they'd love me forever?

857
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,639
Absolutely fucking not.

858
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:02,372
<i>Did I believe that the comms
were secure? Yes.</i>

859
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,372
We all did.

860
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,772
- Hello, my old friend.
- <i>Yes, Mother. All good.</i>

861
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:10,207
Do you have your sneakers on?

862
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:13,205
Good to go.

863
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:14,374
Let's take a drive.

864
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:34,974
<i>Angel to Mother.
We are wheels up.</i>

865
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:36,773
<i>Twenty-seven mikes to LC.</i>

866
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:38,942
<i>We'll be yo-yo
for the next 27 minutes.</i>

867
00:48:54,442 --> 00:48:55,640
So you're telling me

868
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,005
you really wanna bring down
this government?

869
00:48:57,007 --> 00:48:58,375
Why don't you give me the
codes, save us some trouble?

870
00:48:58,809 --> 00:48:59,673
No.

871
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:04,640
Anonymity is a hard concept
for most coders to grasp

872
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:08,240
because it's a hard concept
for most men to grasp.

873
00:49:08,242 --> 00:49:10,507
Most coders are men.

874
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:13,139
This was definitely written
by a woman.

875
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:14,640
<i>Our friend
here has a little bit of</i>

876
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:17,040
<i>an ego. Changes ideology...</i>

877
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:20,740
Do you know
why people commit espionage

878
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:22,005
against their own government?

879
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:23,373
It's mainly money,
right, Dougie?

880
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,707
That's been
my experience, yeah.

881
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:25,707
So if you're not into money,
which I hear you're not.

882
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:27,106
- Is that correct, Alice?
- Right.

883
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:28,006
And it's not ideology,

884
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,173
and nobody's forcing you
to do this.

885
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,208
There can only be
one possible exception.

886
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:33,306
You've got a big ego.

887
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:34,173
It's not ego.

888
00:49:34,175 --> 00:49:35,875
It's everybody's downfall,
my friend.

889
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:37,373
Ego is not your <i>amigo.</i>

890
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,642
I'm gonna find out
what bitch wrote this script.

891
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,342
Change one number,
change the idea.

892
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:49,808
The package
will be received

893
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,106
in Ramstein, Germany.

894
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:52,808
- You don't know me.
- No, I don't know you.

895
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,308
This government
destroyed my family.

896
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,008
Oh.

897
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:58,974
When that shit goes down,

898
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:00,273
if you can't go
to a grocery

899
00:50:00,275 --> 00:50:01,139
'cause nothing's refrigerated,

900
00:50:01,141 --> 00:50:02,440
where are you gonna
get your milk?

901
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:03,875
No. It's a very
lucrative business.

902
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,206
If you get yourself
the Ferrari of goats,

903
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,306
it's pretty expensive.

904
00:50:06,308 --> 00:50:08,610
You wanna text me a link
when we're done with this?

905
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,608
Check out
how calm Meditation Mike is.

906
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,541
- You feeling calm, Alice?
- Not even a little bit.

907
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,106
- Are you?
- I'm totally calm.

908
00:50:15,108 --> 00:50:16,974
That's because
you're mentally unstable.

909
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:18,474
Thank you.

910
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:20,139
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

911
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:22,006
Starting to slow down here.
You got another route for us?

912
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:24,139
Yeah, there's
an incident on this route

913
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:25,741
three blocks ahead.

914
00:50:25,743 --> 00:50:26,907
Rerouting now.

915
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:27,940
Want me to clear out
some of this traffic?

916
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,207
I could pick 'em off, sir.
Clear...

917
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:30,274
Maybe later.

918
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:31,140
How's Angel?

919
00:50:31,142 --> 00:50:32,508
We're green
across the board, sir.

920
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,741
Cruising at 40,000 feet.

921
00:50:33,743 --> 00:50:35,909
Child-One,
switching to alternate route.

922
00:50:36,976 --> 00:50:38,641
Take your next right,
and we'll green-light you

923
00:50:38,643 --> 00:50:40,243
through the next
three intersections.

924
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:47,241
- Slow your roll...
- All this Snapchattin',

925
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:50,374
Facebookin', and bookin'
a face and Instagrammin', sir.

926
00:50:50,376 --> 00:50:51,910
Pick up a goddamn book.

927
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:54,376
Green.

928
00:50:57,309 --> 00:50:58,710
<i>Two, one.</i>

929
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:06,174
<i>You're approaching a "Y".</i>

930
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,877
<i>Bear left on the "Y".</i>

931
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,809
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

932
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,877
Mother, Child-One.
Nice job on the green lights.

933
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:19,376
<i>Make...
Make a left.</i>

934
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:25,309
<i>Seeing additional traffic.
See if we could open that up.</i>

935
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:40,542
Bishop,
I've got seven motorcycles

936
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:41,908
approaching quickly.

937
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,642
They got bikes, Dougie.

938
00:51:43,644 --> 00:51:44,644
I see 'em.

939
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:47,241
<i>The fuck is that?</i>

940
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:49,011
<i>Dougie, Dougie,
get right, get right!</i>

941
00:51:56,877 --> 00:51:58,341
Where'd that come from?

942
00:51:58,343 --> 00:51:59,608
Fuck!

943
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,175
- <i>Watch that motorcycles.</i>
- <i>On your left!</i>

944
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:02,777
- Dougie, get right!
- Get right!

945
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:07,077
Where's the signal?

946
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:11,541
Child-One, Mother.

947
00:52:11,543 --> 00:52:12,543
<i>Status?</i>

948
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,376
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

949
00:52:18,378 --> 00:52:19,942
<i>Looks like the threats
are breaking contact.</i>

950
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:21,975
Check the tape.
What'd we miss?

951
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:23,744
Rewinding footage.

952
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:31,112
Bishop?

953
00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:40,142
This motorcycle's
placed something

954
00:52:40,144 --> 00:52:41,443
on the side of the vehicle.

955
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:53,644
Base, Bretsky,
Reed, KIA.

956
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:01,043
Mother, Child-One,
contact, contact.

957
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,410
Vehicle is down hard.

958
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:14,509
<i>Mother, we're
surrounded, need help.</i>

959
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:16,578
<i>Multiple hostiles
behind vehicles.</i>

960
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:18,175
Alice, go!

961
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:22,142
Back up, back up, back up!

962
00:53:22,144 --> 00:53:23,645
Mother, Child-One. We're
in contact. Major contact.

963
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:39,343
<i>Child-One, Mother.</i>

964
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:41,379
<i>What is the status
of the package?</i>

965
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:43,377
Mother,
we have the package.

966
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:45,312
The car's down hard.
We're evacing now.

967
00:53:46,511 --> 00:53:47,578
Sam, get cover.

968
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:01,511
Mother, Child-One.
We need a new car.

969
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:03,343
On it.

970
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:05,044
They're gonna need
another route.

971
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:06,678
- Big eye, what do you see?
- Yes, sir.

972
00:54:18,112 --> 00:54:19,312
Fuck!

973
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:24,011
Breathe.

974
00:54:25,444 --> 00:54:28,143
Scan all local
law enforcement.

975
00:54:28,145 --> 00:54:30,245
I need to know
how much time we have.

976
00:54:33,946 --> 00:54:35,076
This car looks good.

977
00:54:35,078 --> 00:54:36,810
Child-One, gray BMW,

978
00:54:36,812 --> 00:54:38,779
about 20 meters
in front of you.

979
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:43,679
Dougie, gray BMW,
20 meters, one o'clock.

980
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:45,380
- Yes.
- Get it.

981
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:50,311
<i>Dougie, keep your 12.</i>

982
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:52,445
I'mma flank the fuck
out of these motherfuckers.

983
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:56,512
<i>Stay with the package.</i>

984
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:21,380
Fuck!

985
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,177
Ready?

986
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:26,113
Go! We're getting
out of here now!

987
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:32,146
Where'd that
come from?

988
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:34,313
Silva!

989
00:55:37,346 --> 00:55:38,645
Threat, one o'clock.

990
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:41,079
<i>Blue jacket, magazine stand,
grenade launcher.</i>

991
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,278
Two threats advancing towards

992
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,645
<i>the package
from the right side.</i>

993
00:55:57,013 --> 00:55:58,446
<i>Child-One,
stay with the package.</i>

994
00:56:04,113 --> 00:56:06,413
Child-One,
cover the package.

995
00:56:27,247 --> 00:56:28,846
BMW, now. Go!

996
00:56:34,514 --> 00:56:35,846
Look at me.

997
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:42,681
I'm done.

998
00:56:43,846 --> 00:56:44,846
You did good.

999
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:47,978
Child-One, get out.

1000
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,114
<i>Now.</i>

1001
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:09,647
Go, go, go.

1002
00:57:43,548 --> 00:57:44,845
What the hell
happened back there?

1003
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:46,346
Our car is made.
We need a safe house.

1004
00:57:46,348 --> 00:57:47,713
We need to
regroup immediately.

1005
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:51,481
How far is it?

1006
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:53,112
2.3 miles ahead.

1007
00:57:53,114 --> 00:57:54,246
Is this your idea
of justice, huh?

1008
00:57:54,248 --> 00:57:55,845
Shut your mouth!

1009
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,746
Is it secure?

1010
00:57:56,748 --> 00:57:57,912
I had three hours
to vet the place.

1011
00:57:57,914 --> 00:58:00,780
Fuck vetting.
I don't wanna hear vetting!

1012
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:02,279
Is it secure?

1013
00:58:02,281 --> 00:58:03,513
You know what?
I want the code.

1014
00:58:03,515 --> 00:58:04,713
And I want the code now!

1015
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:05,945
I don't give a shit
about your family.

1016
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:08,080
I don't give a fuck
if you had three hours.

1017
00:58:08,082 --> 00:58:09,945
I take you, and I throw you
out the side...

1018
00:58:09,947 --> 00:58:12,579
Yes, with high confidence,
it's secure.

1019
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:15,713
See? That's all I needed.
High degree of confidence.

1020
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:17,613
Just take me to the airport.
I'll give you what you want.

1021
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:19,515
<i>Take the next
two rights.</i>

1022
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:25,882
<i>Take the next left.</i>

1023
00:58:27,615 --> 00:58:31,147
2-1-4-7-2 is your intro.

1024
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:33,082
<i>Third garage on the right.</i>

1025
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,783
- 214.
- 72.

1026
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:52,616
<i>Entering the den...</i>

1027
00:58:53,549 --> 00:58:54,749
<i>Getting in the networks.</i>

1028
00:58:56,848 --> 00:58:58,080
<i>Visuals up.</i>

1029
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:04,416
<i>Contact is bald, male,
48 years old, blue shirt.</i>

1030
00:59:25,848 --> 00:59:27,815
<i>Examining for
possible threats.</i>

1031
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,314
<i>Do you have
any identifiable threats,</i>

1032
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:35,014
<i>weapons? Any hostiles?</i>

1033
00:59:35,016 --> 00:59:36,480
<i>No anomalous
behavior detected.</i>

1034
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:38,514
<i>Clean vehicle
will be there in six.</i>

1035
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:40,614
<i>Clean vehicle
will be there in six.</i>

1036
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:50,715
<i>Noor files downloaded.</i>

1037
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:54,514
Looks like maybe a study
abroad during university.

1038
00:59:54,516 --> 00:59:56,548
Why would that be redacted?

1039
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:00,447
<i>We need all police to</i>

1040
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:02,148
<i>clear out
the West Papua district.</i>

1041
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,680
<i>Be advised.
Police are being ordered</i>

1042
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:05,983
<i>to clear out of the area.</i>

1043
01:00:16,983 --> 01:00:18,284
Let's get ready
to move.

1044
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:26,383
Jimmy, we don't leave
the reservation.

1045
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:29,015
<i>We've got
armed motorcyclist...</i>

1046
01:00:29,017 --> 01:00:31,848
<i>Armed motorcycles
on either side</i>

1047
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:34,148
<i>of the entrance to the bakery.</i>

1048
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:35,915
<i>Angel, Knight.
Unexpected delay.</i>

1049
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:38,648
<i>Get the fuck
out of there.</i>

1050
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,481
Attack on an American officer
is an act of war.

1051
01:00:41,483 --> 01:00:42,848
I need him back right now.

1052
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,714
Let me give you some advice.

1053
01:00:44,716 --> 01:00:45,815
You ready?

1054
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:47,017
Stop.

1055
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,983
You hear me?

1056
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:50,182
Stop.

1057
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:52,215
This is nothing personal, man.

1058
01:00:52,217 --> 01:00:54,115
- I'm just doing my job.
- I'm just doing mine.

1059
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,215
Sir, I got the scope
on the man.

1060
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:56,515
You want me to take the shot?

1061
01:00:56,517 --> 01:00:57,517
No.

1062
01:00:58,284 --> 01:00:59,148
Please, sir?

1063
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,448
I heard there was a little

1064
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:01,915
unfortunate incident
on the highway.

1065
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:03,315
A little incident?

1066
01:01:03,317 --> 01:01:05,182
I would really hate for it
to happen again.

1067
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:06,848
Are you threatening me?

1068
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,249
We can do this
however you wanna do it.

1069
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:10,249
You gonna keep coming at me
until you kill us all?

1070
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,315
Yeah.

1071
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:13,748
That's a weird fucking game,
but okay, I'll play.

1072
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,515
I mean, you have
home court advantage.

1073
01:01:15,517 --> 01:01:16,515
You have a larger team,

1074
01:01:16,517 --> 01:01:18,283
unlimited resources
due to the support of

1075
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:20,082
a phenomenally
corrupt government

1076
01:01:20,084 --> 01:01:21,348
willing to kill
innocent citizens.

1077
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,149
Plus, a local
special forces which

1078
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:25,781
we designed and trained
and built for you.

1079
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:28,982
Stop monologuing,
you bipolar fuck.

1080
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:30,581
I think he's more
manic-depressed.

1081
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:31,916
Or narcissistic disorder.

1082
01:01:31,918 --> 01:01:33,748
- Dissociative disorder.
- He's just an asshole.

1083
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,049
And let's not forget
about your

1084
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:36,548
absolutely medieval
moral compass

1085
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,116
and nasty thirst for bloodshed

1086
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:39,382
for which there has been
no legal repercussion

1087
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:41,683
because you do not operate
under any rule of law.

1088
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:43,382
Chaos.

1089
01:01:43,384 --> 01:01:44,749
- That's right, Jimmy.
- Yeah, but you know what?

1090
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:45,916
What's that, Jimmy?

1091
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:47,185
I think I might just be
a little worse.

1092
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:51,516
<i>Child-One, Mother,
move the package now.</i>

1093
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,951
Get him in the car now.
Let's go.

1094
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:57,551
Let's go.

1095
01:02:05,651 --> 01:02:07,384
Bomb! Get down now!

1096
01:02:22,884 --> 01:02:25,252
Child-One, Mother.
Status, please.

1097
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:47,383
Shit.

1098
01:02:47,385 --> 01:02:49,052
- Anywhere else?
- I don't think so.

1099
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:57,052
Let's go.

1100
01:03:11,618 --> 01:03:12,716
In the fucking car, now!

1101
01:03:12,718 --> 01:03:13,783
Let's go.

1102
01:03:28,552 --> 01:03:30,518
<i>Child-One, gunmen.</i>

1103
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:35,085
Go. Move!

1104
01:03:36,819 --> 01:03:38,052
I've got package in tow.

1105
01:03:47,785 --> 01:03:49,187
Okay.

1106
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:58,350
Alice, status?

1107
01:03:58,352 --> 01:03:59,418
He is fine.

1108
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,218
Come on, Dougie.
Get your shit together.

1109
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,650
He is fine. You just keep
fuckin' driving.

1110
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:05,350
You pull this shit
on me now?

1111
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:07,851
<i>Mother, package in tow.
We have one critical.</i>

1112
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:09,616
We need a new vehicle ASAP.

1113
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:10,683
What's the ETA on the plane?

1114
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:12,918
- Twenty-two minutes.
- How many miles out are we?

1115
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,918
- Twelve.
- Child-One, no time.

1116
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,984
Get your ass
to the airstrip now.

1117
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,187
Copy, Mother.

1118
01:04:35,853 --> 01:04:37,287
- Go, go!
- Spread out, spread out!

1119
01:04:43,686 --> 01:04:45,120
Get him in the building
behind us.

1120
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,953
Get out of my face.

1121
01:04:52,553 --> 01:04:53,553
Go.

1122
01:04:58,221 --> 01:04:59,221
Now.

1123
01:05:04,352 --> 01:05:05,586
I got you. Yeah.

1124
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,951
You've got it?

1125
01:05:08,953 --> 01:05:10,653
Paradise Apartment Complex.

1126
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:14,384
I got you. I got you.

1127
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,852
Oh, you give 'em hell, Dougie.

1128
01:05:33,854 --> 01:05:35,653
You just get him
to the airport.

1129
01:05:37,654 --> 01:05:39,986
I will. All right, brother.

1130
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:59,452
Every normal man must be
tempted at times

1131
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:03,352
- <i>to spit upon his hands...</i>
- <i>Alice!</i>

1132
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:04,818
...hoist the black flag...

1133
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,452
<i>Silva,
you better be moving.</i>

1134
01:06:06,454 --> 01:06:09,087
...and begin slitting throats.

1135
01:07:15,121 --> 01:07:16,522
Fuck.

1136
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:24,821
- We got a car?
- I do.

1137
01:07:28,288 --> 01:07:29,386
Mother, Child-One.

1138
01:07:29,388 --> 01:07:30,852
You gotta get us
the way out of here ASAP.

1139
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:32,420
Child-One,
working on extraction point.

1140
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:34,220
<i>Get to the south staircase.</i>

1141
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:35,620
Alice, this way.

1142
01:07:35,622 --> 01:07:38,653
<i>I repeat.
Get to the south staircase.</i>

1143
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:40,655
<i>Copy that.
Heading south.</i>

1144
01:08:00,854 --> 01:08:01,854
Sir, I've got eyes.

1145
01:08:07,223 --> 01:08:08,423
Come on.

1146
01:08:28,389 --> 01:08:29,487
<i>Mother,
we are on the fourth level.</i>

1147
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:30,587
<i>What's the route?</i>

1148
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:31,788
<i>How the fuck
do I get out of here?</i>

1149
01:08:33,456 --> 01:08:36,254
Extraction point is at the end
of the second hallway,

1150
01:08:36,256 --> 01:08:38,323
<i>coming up on your right.</i>

1151
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:51,690
<i>Child-One, exit is 20 yards
in front of you. R-447.</i>

1152
01:08:53,656 --> 01:08:55,654
<i>That'll take you
to the extraction point</i>

1153
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:57,554
<i>in the rear courtyard.</i>

1154
01:08:57,556 --> 01:08:59,956
Shit! Back up,
back up, back up!

1155
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:05,720
Go.

1156
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:13,855
Fuck!

1157
01:09:23,224 --> 01:09:25,121
Move, move. Back up!

1158
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:36,623
Back up, back up. Now!

1159
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:41,789
They're separated.

1160
01:09:45,822 --> 01:09:46,822
Fuck!

1161
01:09:50,423 --> 01:09:51,623
Jimmy, do you copy?

1162
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,923
Jimmy, do you copy?

1163
01:10:03,123 --> 01:10:04,388
Mother,
I have the package.

1164
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,990
<i>Do you have eyes on Alice?</i>

1165
01:10:08,023 --> 01:10:10,021
- <i>Mother?</i>
- Negative.

1166
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:11,222
Mother, Child-One, reroute us.

1167
01:10:11,224 --> 01:10:14,589
The route out is directly
behind you. Take it.

1168
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:18,121
<i>Stairwell, Romeo-445.</i>

1169
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:31,021
- No.
- Child-One, no what?

1170
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:35,023
No! I'm want a route to Alice.
Reroute me to Alice now.

1171
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,121
<i>It's before Bingo Fuel.
Where's the package?</i>

1172
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:41,325
Ten minutes. We're counting.

1173
01:10:42,023 --> 01:10:44,357
Child-One, it's time.

1174
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:50,422
You understand a little girl
who calls her mother every day

1175
01:10:50,424 --> 01:10:51,555
because she misses her?

1176
01:10:51,557 --> 01:10:53,189
Because her mother is not home
with her?

1177
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:54,323
She's here with you.

1178
01:10:54,325 --> 01:10:56,457
She is here for you.

1179
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:13,989
Option one,
open the disc and end this.

1180
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:15,056
Exit.

1181
01:11:15,058 --> 01:11:16,591
Option two, we let her die.

1182
01:11:18,258 --> 01:11:21,256
<i>Repeat,
the order is to exit.</i>

1183
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:22,824
Now!

1184
01:11:24,024 --> 01:11:25,357
Let's go get her.

1185
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,056
<i>Let's go get her.</i>

1186
01:11:28,058 --> 01:11:29,692
Son of a bitch.

1187
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:35,223
Do not fuck me.

1188
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:36,355
Let's go.

1189
01:11:36,357 --> 01:11:37,958
Mother, Child-One.
Make it dark in here.

1190
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:40,855
Fine.

1191
01:12:24,825 --> 01:12:26,358
Go.

1192
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:46,591
Silva, do you copy?

1193
01:12:46,593 --> 01:12:49,559
Silva, do you copy?
Silva, do you copy?

Hey, Jimmy, all you had to do
was hand him over.

1197
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,327
<i>Who?
You mean the low-level cop?</i>

1198
01:15:08,695 --> 01:15:10,592
What's the rush, Jimmy?
You got somewhere to be?

1199
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:11,858
- Fuck you.
- I could do this

1200
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,894
all day, baby.

1201
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,833
Please. I'm a...

1202
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:35,853
Please, I'm a mother. Please.

1203
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:38,717
I have a...

1204
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,252
I have a daughter.

1205
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,284
Hey, Jimmy, you and I, we
could have made a great team.

1206
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:01,751
You happen to have any more
.45 caliber ammo back there?

1207
01:16:01,753 --> 01:16:03,085
Here it is!

1208
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:19,118
Let's go. Now. Move.

1209
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,186
Fucking wasted 10 minutes
coming back for you.

1210
01:17:35,353 --> 01:17:36,351
Child-One,

1211
01:17:36,353 --> 01:17:39,285
<i>Nissan pickup,
back parking lot.</i>

1212
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:42,221
<i>Repeat. It's at the back
of the building.</i>

1213
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:47,385
Come on, come on.

1214
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:48,387
Let's go.

1215
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:05,185
Mother, Child-One.
What's our route?

1216
01:18:05,187 --> 01:18:06,585
<i>Child-One,
stand by for new route.</i>

1217
01:18:10,888 --> 01:18:12,119
<i>Child-One...</i>

1218
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:15,351
Child-One, the route
is directly behind you.

1219
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:16,353
<i>Take it.</i>

1220
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:23,619
- <i>Engines turning.</i>
- <i>Copy that. Roger.</i>

1221
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:25,586
<i>We're buttoned up.
Oscar Mike.</i>

1222
01:18:25,588 --> 01:18:26,986
- <i>We are set.
- Let's go.</i>

1223
01:18:26,988 --> 01:18:29,688
The end of an operation
is euphoric.

1224
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:36,553
It's placing that last piece
in the puzzle.

1225
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:40,619
You know
the euphoria cannot last.

1226
01:18:40,621 --> 01:18:42,252
<i>Ten minutes
to Bingo Fuel.</i>

1227
01:18:42,254 --> 01:18:43,486
<i>Where is your package?</i>

1228
01:18:43,488 --> 01:18:45,419
<i>Window is closing.
We need to be wheels-up now!</i>

1229
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:47,085
Get your ass
to the airstrip now.

1230
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:48,920
<i>Yeah,
I'm working on that.</i>

1231
01:18:48,922 --> 01:18:50,419
You tell yourself,
"This one time..."

1232
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:52,686
<i>If I wait, we're all
gonna die. Hurry the fuck up!</i>

1233
01:18:52,688 --> 01:18:53,955
"...just might be different."

1234
01:18:57,454 --> 01:18:58,619
"Just might be different."

1235
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:08,956
"Today I just might be able
to just hold it, catch it

1236
01:19:11,388 --> 01:19:13,288
"in my hands
and look at it."

1237
01:19:16,187 --> 01:19:17,421
<i>Tell them to stop the plane.
We're here.</i>

1238
01:19:27,023 --> 01:19:30,023
Mother, we don't have time
for this.

1239
01:19:30,856 --> 01:19:32,154
- King.
- Yup.

1240
01:19:33,889 --> 01:19:36,789
Child-One, Mother.
My pleasure.

1241
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:40,956
Target acquired.

1242
01:19:41,388 --> 01:19:42,388
Take it.

1243
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:50,956
Let's go.

1244
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:57,620
What's the status
of the plane?

1245
01:19:57,622 --> 01:19:59,154
<i>The LZ's hot.
We're rolling.</i>

1246
01:20:00,023 --> 01:20:00,921
Child-One...

1247
01:20:00,923 --> 01:20:02,088
You tell those fuckers
to wait.

1248
01:20:04,522 --> 01:20:06,921
They're gonna stay put
no matter what.

1249
01:20:06,923 --> 01:20:08,086
<i>Overwatch is requesting...</i>

1250
01:20:08,088 --> 01:20:09,754
<i>Negative.
The window is closing.</i>

1251
01:20:09,756 --> 01:20:13,520
Tell those pilots
I don't give a fuck!

1252
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:15,422
<i>Tell 'em we're here.
We're on the runway now.</i>

1253
01:20:17,923 --> 01:20:19,921
<i>Holy shit! Abort!
Abort! Abort!</i>

1254
01:20:19,923 --> 01:20:21,754
<i>Abort! Abort! Abort!</i>

1255
01:20:21,756 --> 01:20:23,654
<i>Abort! Copy that.
We're aborting!</i>

1256
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:25,120
<i>Okay. Tell me
when the package is there.</i>

1257
01:20:25,122 --> 01:20:26,155
<i>Copy.</i>

1258
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,587
Let's go. Move.

1259
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:30,587
Code. Now.

1260
01:20:30,589 --> 01:20:31,790
Hey.

1261
01:20:32,589 --> 01:20:34,122
You got something for me now?

1262
01:20:34,924 --> 01:20:40,520
R-O-Z-H-D-E-S-T-V-O...

1263
01:20:40,522 --> 01:20:41,823
<i>1-1-1.</i>

1264
01:20:42,556 --> 01:20:44,387
Mother, Child-One,
Rebel, Oz...

1265
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,353
<i>R-O-Z-H-D-</i>

1266
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:47,721
E-S-T...
- <i>Trust, Virgin,</i>

1267
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:50,757
- <i>Oyster, triple-one.</i>
- V-O-1-1-1.

1268
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:52,922
This is a hard line of work.

1269
01:20:52,924 --> 01:20:54,222
What line is that? Witchcraft?

1270
01:20:55,088 --> 01:20:56,054
Our line.

1271
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:58,420
We are not in the same line.
Respectfully.

1272
01:20:58,422 --> 01:21:00,289
Respectfully, we are.

1273
01:21:03,957 --> 01:21:06,655
It stopped. The clock stopped.

1274
01:21:06,657 --> 01:21:08,186
We have five locations
of the caesium.

1275
01:21:08,188 --> 01:21:10,321
Five locations
have been confirmed.

1276
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:12,086
They're being sent to Langley.

1277
01:21:12,088 --> 01:21:14,222
<i>He's clear.
Put him on the plane.</i>

1278
01:21:15,256 --> 01:21:16,256
Go.

1279
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:19,321
Hands up.

1280
01:21:19,323 --> 01:21:20,323
Embark.

1281
01:21:22,156 --> 01:21:23,221
<i>He's clear.</i>

1282
01:21:23,223 --> 01:21:24,421
This might actually work.

1283
01:21:24,423 --> 01:21:25,688
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Let's move.

1284
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:26,755
<i>Let's get this package
out of here.</i>

1285
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:27,990
<i>Clear.</i>

1286
01:21:30,656 --> 01:21:32,521
You got six days. Go.

1287
01:21:32,523 --> 01:21:33,523
Go be a mother.

1288
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:35,157
Go.

1289
01:21:38,123 --> 01:21:39,391
I'll be back in five.

1290
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:44,291
Oh, hey.

1291
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,489
Say hello to your Mother
for me.

1292
01:21:53,057 --> 01:21:54,258
My what?

1293
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:56,189
Say hello to who?

1294
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:57,823
What the fuck did you say?

1295
01:22:10,124 --> 01:22:11,456
What are you doing?

1296
01:22:19,258 --> 01:22:20,723
It's odd.
They're spiking.

1297
01:22:21,756 --> 01:22:24,124
Maybe he doesn't like planes.

1298
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,455
Bishop, look.

1299
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:46,824
It's taking over our computer.

1300
01:22:49,357 --> 01:22:50,824
It's not done encoding.

1301
01:22:57,958 --> 01:22:59,488
Who's that?

1302
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,490
Who is that?

1303
01:23:07,757 --> 01:23:08,757
What is this?

1304
01:23:11,924 --> 01:23:13,391
Meditation, Alice.

1305
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,059
Keeps me focused on the job.

1306
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:19,657
The code is Russian.

1307
01:23:20,757 --> 01:23:22,555
Jesus. All things Russian.

1308
01:23:22,557 --> 01:23:25,822
The code word is Russian
for Christmas.

1309
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,757
It says 111 Christmas...

1310
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:29,590
Christmas Street?

1311
01:23:32,858 --> 01:23:34,724
It's a Trojan horse op.

1312
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:41,856
<i>Take off, wheels up.</i>

1313
01:23:41,858 --> 01:23:43,391
He's not a double agent.

1314
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:48,325
He's a triple agent.

1315
01:24:04,059 --> 01:24:05,589
Oh, my God.

1316
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:06,489
He's a Russian.

1317
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:09,157
Child-One, Mother.
Keep them on the ground.

1318
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:10,825
<i>I repeat. Keep them on the...</i>

1319
01:24:14,525 --> 01:24:15,525
Gotcha.

1320
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:17,292
No!

1321
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:34,426
<i>This is
a very simple story.</i>

1322
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:38,825
Killed the wrong kid.

1323
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:42,491
<i>Eighteen years of age...</i>

1324
01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:47,589
<i>A mother lost her son,</i>

1325
01:24:47,591 --> 01:24:50,656
<i>and it turns out
she was a very powerful lady.</i>

1326
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:58,589
Failure of imagination.

1327
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:00,225
<i>You mean
the death of Overwatch.</i>

1328
01:25:01,558 --> 01:25:02,656
Death of what?

1329
01:25:02,658 --> 01:25:03,824
Overwatch.

1330
01:25:03,826 --> 01:25:05,359
You were the target.

1331
01:25:06,591 --> 01:25:08,091
<i>Mayday!
Package is armed</i>

1332
01:25:08,093 --> 01:25:09,223
<i>and attempting hostile...</i>

1333
01:25:09,225 --> 01:25:10,556
He did everything right.

1334
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:12,691
He was unpredictable.
Highly trained.

1335
01:25:14,259 --> 01:25:15,857
<i>Recruited
when he was young.</i>

1336
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:17,524
He convinced us
he did not trust us,

1337
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:19,359
and then convinced us
to trust him.

1338
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:26,490
Do you wanna
talk about Alice?

1339
01:25:26,492 --> 01:25:29,058
Do you wanna talk about what
happened on that airplane?

1340
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,158
<i>Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!</i>

1341
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,524
<i>Cockpit has been breached!</i>

1342
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,590
<i>Package is armed.
Direct to immediate LZ.</i>

1343
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:34,726
No.

1344
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:40,924
<i>You already know this.</i>

1345
01:25:40,926 --> 01:25:42,024
Tell me again.

1346
01:25:42,026 --> 01:25:43,393
I've already gone over this
with you.

1347
01:25:45,226 --> 01:25:49,094
They activated him
to make us activate Overwatch.

1348
01:25:52,459 --> 01:25:53,691
Say hello to your Mother
for me.

1349
01:25:53,693 --> 01:25:55,624
<i>Bishop, come in.
Can you hear me?</i>

1350
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:57,724
<i>Bishop, can you
hear me? Bishop? Over.</i>

1351
01:25:57,726 --> 01:25:59,025
I think there is no defense

1352
01:25:59,027 --> 01:26:00,191
against someone
willing to die.

1353
01:26:00,193 --> 01:26:02,258
Someone capable
of cultivating our trust

1354
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,490
by offering us
the one thing that we want,

1355
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,992
and the one thing
that we need,

1356
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,659
that's the real weapon
of mass destruction.

1357
01:26:10,061 --> 01:26:11,693
A killer
who looks like a hero.

1358
01:26:17,427 --> 01:26:19,160
<i>The great game continues.</i>

1359
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:25,593
<i>Today was yours.</i>

1360
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:38,760
I'll see you tomorrow.
